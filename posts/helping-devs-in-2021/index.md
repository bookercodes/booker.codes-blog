This year, I am keen to practice coding, inspire other devs to learn in public, and **help devs get hired**. I figure if I can help people achieve their dreams, they'll help me achieve mine.

I see an exciting opportunity to offer help I couldn't find when I started, and a fantastic alignment between this personal objective and my professional work at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).

At the moment, I have two barriers obstructing me:

1. I want to know who's hiring juniors and what they are looking for
2. I, myself, need to learn about important soft skills

I also have two opportunities,

1. I am "self-made" - that is, I learned to code on YouTube and launched a successful career without a degree
2. I am good at marketing and communication (writing), and can teach others how to be seen and heard

Here are some resources I can look to for inspiration:

- [Build a portfolio that appeals to employers](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/) (free)
- [The Coding Career Handbook](https://www.learninpublic.org/) ($59)
- [Soft Skills to Advance your Developer Career](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Soft-Skills-Advance-Developer-Career/dp/1484250915/ref=sr_1_15?dchild=1&keywords=soft+skills&qid=1609510240&sr=8-15)
- [Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Soft-Skills-Software-Developers-Manual/dp/0999081446/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=soft+skills&qid=1609510240&sr=8-1) ($20)

Broadly, I see a few key areas to focus on:

- Learning in public
- Resumes
- Portfolios
- Interviews
- Blogging
- Job-hunting strategies
- Project ideas

Next, I need to understand Scrimba's goals and how to smash them. This isn't something I can decide alone - I will deliberate with the team next week!

Finally, ask myself, **what is my specific goal?** **Of all these opportunities, how can I create the greatest impact?**
