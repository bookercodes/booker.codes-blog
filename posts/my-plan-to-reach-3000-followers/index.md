This year, I am on a mission to help devs, **ESPECIALLY** new devs aspiring to make a career during unprecedented, uncertain, and extraordinary times.

I am inspired by creators I have met through my work at Scrimba. Creators like [@Cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo), [@DThompsonDev](https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev), and [@PizzaPokerGuy](https://twitter.com/PizzaPokerGuy).

I see some opportunities:

* Content on Twitter lacks **substance** and **personality**
	* Many threads (for example, [this one](https://twitter.com/TheAnkurTyagi/status/1345282056998199297)) lack substance. In my view, Twitter is not the right medium for this content 
	* People follow people. Showing personality makes you vulnerable. I believe the cost is high, but the reward is even higher - an authentic relationship with your audience. @DThompsonDev and @Cassidoo are exceptional at this.
* “Computer Programming” topic on Twitter is a bubble. I believe I can bring new, valuable perspectives of engineering managers, recruiters, entrepreneurs, customers, and other professionals

In the past, I have misused Twitter by only using it as a megaphone. In other words, I only Tweeted to promote things and I only Tweeted to my own timeline. 

To circumvent this, I made a Twitter list called [“People helping code newbies”](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1345474046507544577). I am going to try and bring value to their threads and see what happens. 

I expect some people to follow me, but more importantly, this will help me better understand people's problems.

When I see a common, unaddressed problem, I can make content that resonates.

I will endeavor to be “early” by sorting Tweets in the list by recentness and even turning on notifications for my favourite accounts.

The more interactions I have, the more I can learn. While participating in conversations on Twitter can lead to organic reach, in my opinion, that doesn’t scale. I can worry about that later. Today, I need to get off the ground (3,000 followers).

I will also endeavor to champion aspiring junior developers by following them, liking their posts, and responding when I can. This high touch technique could be rewarding for me.

One barrier (and something that kind of intimidates me) is that **people tend to follow people who have been there and done that**. At least, that angle resonates. A video entitled [The Resume That Got me into Google](https://youtu.be/aKjsy-b00QM) will always go viral. Other videos on developer resumes don't come close. This is something I can worry about later.

## Canvas strategy

While I have a lot to learn, that shouldn’t stop me from making progress. 

I already have some ideas about what I can share on my own timeline such as learning resources, things I learn from books, things I learn from podcasts and other content on Twitter. 

I am aiming to make and promote “friends”. For example, I really like what @DThompsonDev is doing, and I would do well to share the love. Better yet, if I can find smaller accounts (around my size) to promote, we can achieve our goals together. This is what [Chris](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqr-7GDVTsdNBCeufvERYuw) and I did in the early days with our [Livecoding a JavaScript poll](https://youtu.be/M7g76xnRxmA) video series, and it worked great.

In these early days, I see an opportunity to be a content syndicator. I like this idea of sitting down with headphones in, listening, and taking notes from a podcast or soft skills books. By turning what I learn into digestible content, I can promote the original author. By promoting their work in a way that make them look smart (giving them something easy to share), that will come back around in a good way. That is the canvas strategy.
