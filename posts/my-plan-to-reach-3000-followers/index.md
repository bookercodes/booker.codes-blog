This year, I am going on a mission to **help devs**, ESPECIALLY newer devs aspiring to make a career during these turbulent times. 

I have been inspired by people I’ve met through my work at Scrimba like Cassidoo and DannyTThompson. Hearing Stories like Austeja’s first hand and seeing the positive reaction to my React interview tips post on dev.to, and the live-streams Per and I have hosted has been very encouraging, and I am excited to keep going.

I see some opportunities:

* Content on Twitter lacks **substance** and **personality**
	* Many threads (for example, [this one](https://twitter.com/TheAnkurTyagi/status/1345282056998199297)) lack substance. In my view, Twitter is not the right medium for this content 
	* People follow people. Showing personality makes you vulnerable. I believe the cost is high, but the reward is even higher - an authentic relationship with your audience
* “Computer Programming” topic on Twitter is a bubble. I believe I can bring new, valuable perspectives of engineering managers, recruiters, entrepreneurs, customers, and other professionals

In the past, I have misused Twitter by only using it like a megaphone. In other words, I only Tweeted to promote things and I only Tweeted to my own timeline. 

I made a list called “People helping code newbies”. I am going to try and bring value to their threads and see what happens. 

I expect some people will follow me but more importantly, this will help me better understand the problems people face. 

When I see a common, unaddressed, problem, I can make content that resonates. I will endeavour to be “early” by sorting the list timeline by new and even turning on notifications for my favourite accounts. My theory is that being early will provide better visibility. 

The more interactions I have, the more I can learn. While participating in conversations on Twitter can lead to organic reach, in my opinion, that doesn’t scale. This post you’re reading is only my strategy to get off the ground.

Followers aren’t that important to me. I need a more personable and striking avatar. Plus, I need answer “why you should follow me” in my banner image and bio. This is basic, but gaining followers is not that important to me at the moment. 

I can’t honestly answer why I should care about followers - it doesn’t mean much to me, aside from a loose proxy for reach. 


The biggest barrier I see is that people tend to follow people who have been there and done that. People on the same course, and a little beyond them. I think this is something I have to put aside.

## Canvas strategy
While I have a lot to learn, that shouldn’t stop me from making progress. 

I already have some ideas about what I can share on my own timeline such as learning resources, things I learn from books, things I learn from podcasts and other content on Twitter. 

I am aiming to make and promote “friends”. For example, I really like what DannyTThompson is sharing and I should share the love. Better yet, if I can find smaller accounts (around my size) to promote, we can achieve our goals together. This is what Chris and I did in the early  days with our Livecoding a JavaScript poll video series, and it worked great.

In these early days, I see an opportunity to be a content syndicator. I like this idea of sitting down with headphones in, listening and taking notes from a podcast or soft skills books. By turning what I learn into digestible content, I can promote the original author. By giving them visibility, make them look smart (giving them something easy to share), that will come back around in a good way. That is the canvas strategy. 

By the way, this is all fucking scary. I’ll publish this in public now because, realistically, who is going to read it? If people do read it, that is a good problem to have!
